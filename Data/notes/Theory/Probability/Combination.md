**Unordered count** of *k* objects from n distinct objects 

$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$

Example 1: The first draw in five card draw poker is for a player to receive 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards. How many hands are possible in this game?

$$
\text{Number of 5-card hands} = \binom{52}{5} = \frac{52!}{5!(52 - 5)!} = \frac{52!}{5! \cdot 47!}
$$
