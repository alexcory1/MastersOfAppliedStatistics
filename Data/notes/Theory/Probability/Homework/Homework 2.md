1. Three plants manufacture hard drives and ship them to a warehouse for distribution. Plant I produces  54% of the warehouse’s inventory with a 4% defect rate. Plant II produces 35% of the warehouse’s inventory with an 8% defect rate. Plant III produces the remainder of the warehouse’s inventory with a 12% defect rate.  

Let plant I be denoted as A, II as B, and III as C

(a) A warehouse inspector selects one hard drive at random. What is the probability that it is a  
defective hard drive and from Plant II?  
$P(B\cap\text{defective}) = .35 * .08 = 0.028$
(b) What is the probability that a randomly selected hard drive is defective?  
$P(A\cap\text{defective})+P(B\cap\text{defective})+P(C\cap\text{defective}) = .54*.04+.35*.08+.11*.12=.0628$
(c) Suppose a hard drive is defective. What is the probability that it came from Plant II?
$P(B|\text{defective}) = \frac{P(\text{defective|B})P(\text{defective})}{P(B)} = \frac{.04*.54}{.0628}$
