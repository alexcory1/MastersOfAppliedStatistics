p(y)=P(Y=y) is the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in S assigned to the outcome y of the random variable Y.

These probabilities, called the Probability Mass Function, or PMF, summarizes all possibnble values of Y and their associated probabilities p(y)

We can display a PMF as a table, graph, or formula

Example Table:

| y    | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p(y) | 1/8 | 3/8 | 3/8 | 1/8 |

Example Formula:
$p(y)=\binom{n}{y}p^n$
