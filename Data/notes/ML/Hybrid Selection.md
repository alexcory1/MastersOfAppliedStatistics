#cross-validation
• Best subset, forward, and backward stepwise will generally  
give similar but not identical models.  
• An alternative is a hybrid version of forward/backward  
selection: stepwise selection.  
• At each step, you are not restricted to one direction. You can  
add and remove predictors.  
• Stepwise selection attempts to mimic subset selection while  
still retaining computational advantage.
