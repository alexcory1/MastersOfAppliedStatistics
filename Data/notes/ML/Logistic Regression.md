#Regression
Logistic regression is a type of [[Regression]] pertaining to classification.
Models the probability that a feature belongs to a category

p(x) = $\frac{exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... \beta_pX_p)}{1+exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... \beta_pX_p)}$


Estimating $\hat{\beta}$'s: [[Maximum Likelihood Estimate]]
Intuition: find $\beta$ where $\hat{p}$ are large when Y=1 and small when Y=0
